On the first line, I imported random module so I could get random numbers for my healthpotion.
I created a variable 'health' and made its value 50.
I created another variable 'difficulty' which will be between 1 to 3 where 1 being the easiest, 2 being the medium, and 3 being the hardest level.
Created another variable 'potion_health' where I used random.randint(a,b) function to get numbers between 25 and 50. Then according to the difficulty level of the game, the random number will get divided by it which means if the game is on easy level health potion would be higher if not health potion value would be lower. Then used the int type funciont to get the whole number instead of float number.
updated the 'health' variable after consuming the 'health_potion'.
printing the updated 'health' variable.
